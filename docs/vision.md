# SightSignal Vision

## Purpose

SightSignal lets people place and discover real-time signals on a map, from hazards to community events, with a focus on fast reporting, trust, and low friction.

## Product principles

- UX first: fast, beautiful, and minimal.
- Low cost: free-tier compatible and serverless-friendly.
- Contract-first: clean interfaces to swap providers.
- Trust-aware: reputation and vetting reduce spam.

## Primary actors

- Visitor: browses sightings and reactions without registering.
- Reporter: submits sightings with optional media and details.
- Subscriber: draws or follows geofences and receives alerts.
- Registered user: saved geofences, subscriptions, API keys.
- Vetted user: contributes to validation and trust signals.
- Moderator/admin: manages taxonomy, spam, and policies.

## Core journeys

- Report: drop a pin, choose type/category, add details, submit.
- Explore: browse map + list, filter by type/time/status.
- React: add emoji reactions and mark not relevant.
- Subscribe: draw or follow a geofence, select alert types.
- Trust: earn reputation through useful interactions.

## Non-goals (near-term)

- Full social network features.
- Paid tiers.
- Heavy analytics or ad targeting.
